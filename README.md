# IoT_Plant_Auto_Monitoring_and_Watering_System

The main aim of this project was to create an IoT system where an array of sensors would be used to collect data from the IoT device's deployed location, and receive data from a weather API and use these 2 sets of data to make decisions about whether or not to switch the sprinklers on. The sensors used by the system are a DS18B20 temperature sensor (encased in a stainless steel waterproof capsule so that it can be embedded in the soil), a soil moisture sensor, and a light sensor in the form of a photoresistor. The API used for receiving weather data was the OpenWeather API. While the system wasn't able to acheive full intended functionality, it is able to make decisions regarding the state of the sprinklers, in this case represented by a solenoid valve. If the moisutre of the soil drops below a designated threshold, in this code it is 73%, then the solenoid valve will open allowing water to flow out of the sprinkler(s) and raising the moisture of the soil back above the threshold before closing again. If the temperature is freezing or below or if the weather data from the OpenWeather API says it is raining, the valve will remain closed regardless of the moisture of the level.
